==========
This folder contains 'static' ports of FreeRTOS.
The ports for FreeRTOS are generated by Processor Expert, 
but no Processor Expert is needed as the files are already generated, 
and the projects do not need Processor Expert.

To change the RTOS, you can adopt the FreeRTOSconfig.h header file.
