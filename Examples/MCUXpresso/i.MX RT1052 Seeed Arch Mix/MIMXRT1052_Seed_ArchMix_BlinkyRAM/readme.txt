----------
This is a RAM project for debugging the Seeed Studio Arch RT1052 (CVL5B) board.

Notes:
- only works with a NXP LPC-Link! Segger J-Link (Mini EDU) fails to properly debug the target.
- to use this project, it requries the device already booted up with the Arch Mix default firmware installed (see links below)
