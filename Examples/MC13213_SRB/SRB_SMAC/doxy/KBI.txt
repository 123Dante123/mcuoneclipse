\page page_KBI Lab: Keyboard Interrupt
\author Erich Styger, erich.styger@hslu.ch

\section s_requirement Requirements
For the SRB board we are using the keyboard interrupt. The interrupt shall directly set the proper event.
Then handle the event and the main application using EVNT_HandleEvent() and write a message to the shell.

\section s_hints Hints
- Have a method KEY_Interrupt() declared in Keys.h and defined in Keys.c
- Make sure the KBI component interrupt is calling your keyboard KEY_Interrupt() function
- Add the proper event using EVNT_SetEvent()
- Have fun :-)  

\section s_journal Questions
- none :-)
