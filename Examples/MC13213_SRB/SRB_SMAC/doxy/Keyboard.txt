\section s_requirement Requirements
We are going to use buttons. For now we are *not* using interrupts.
The Tower board anyway does not allow us to use interrupts.
The application shall work both on the Tower as well on the SRB board.

\section s_hardware Hardware
- SRB
  - SW0: PTA2
  - SW1: PTA3
  - SW2: PTA4
  - SW3: PTA5
- Tower
  - SW1: GPT0
  - SW3: GPT1    

\section s_hints Hints
- Integrate Keys.c and Keys.h
- Use the KBI component for the SRB board. Do not forget to configure the pull-ups.
- Do not forget to call your initialization method from PL_Init().
- Use the BitIO component for the Tower board.
- In Keys.c there is already a shell implementation to show the status of the keys. Verify that it works.
- Use what you have learned implementing the LED.c driver.
- Make sure everything is documented using doxygen.
- Have fun :-)  

\section s_journal Questions
- What is the difference between the switch/key hardware between the SRB board and the Tower board? Why?
- How would your code look like for switches which are connected to pull-down resistors instead of pull-up resistors?
