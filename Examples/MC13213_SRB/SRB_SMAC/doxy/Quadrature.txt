\section s_requirement Requirements
Following functionality shall be supported:
- Decoding signal provided by quadratic decoder
- Counting the steps of the motor (quadrature encoder steps)
- Report in shell
  - The current position
  - The number of errors

\section s_hints Hints
- Use QuadCounter.c and QuadCounter.h as starting point
- Make sure get the C1 and C2 signals correctly.
- The version without error correction is provided
- Use QUAD_USE_ERROR_CORRECTION to enable/disable error correction
- Complete the quadrature decoding tables (QUAD_Table) in Quadrature.c
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- Check the encoder data sheet and the motor data sheet:
  calculate the signal rate with maximum speed and the used encoder and document it
- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem:
  you will need to sample the signal twice as fast as the max signal frequency: what is your required sampling frequency?
- Why it could be a good idea to connect C1 and C2 signals to a bit 0 and bit 1 of a port?
- When will you get errors in your decoding/counting algorithm?
- Compare the decoder with error correction and the one without.
  At which speed the one without error correction will start producing errors?
  At which speed the one with error correction starts producing errors?
