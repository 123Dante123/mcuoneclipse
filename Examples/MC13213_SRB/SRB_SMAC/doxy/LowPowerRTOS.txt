\page page_LowPowerRTOS Lab: Low Power RTOS
\author Erich Styger, erich.styger@hslu.ch

\section s_requirement Requirements
We measure the power consumption of our board/CPU and are going to reduce it.
As we are using an RTOS, we need to make sure the low power modes are controlled through the RTOS hooks.

\section s_hints Hints
- Make sure that your board is entering low power mode if the application has nothing to do
- For this, use the idle hook of the RTOS and enter low power mode
- Use an LED you can visually inspect or monitor using a logic analyzer 
- We need a way to measure the power in an easier way. Unfortunately this is not easily possible with the SRB board.
  But we can easily do this using the J4 jumper on the Tower board.
- Have fun :-)  

\section s_journal Questions
- In which case the vApplicationIdleHook() might not be called if you set a breakpoint there?
  Think about the reasons (this will give you hopfully the solutions). If not, ask your instructor.
- Changing the CPU core speed dynamically is a way to reduce power. What are the consequences
  of this for your application?
- Consult the board schematics and come up with some ideas how to measure the power differently.
  Which ones would you consider?
  What would be the pros/cons of other measure points?
- The blinking LEDs are affecting your measurement: how could you make your measurement easier
  to single out the impact of the LEDs?
- Measuring power consumption might be challenging. Why? How could you solve these problems?
