\section s_requirement Requirements
We intergrate drivers for the accelerometer sensors on the TWR and SRB board.
We learn how to calibrate them and how to get sensor values. 
Finally we write the values both to the shell and the LCD display.

\section s_Hints Hints
- Make sure you map the correct pins for your driver, with the proper A/D channel
- Think about a useful implementation in ACCEL_Init(): could you think about using calibration to initialized the sensor?
- Enable the shell interface and try it out
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- Why is there a need to calibrate the sensor?
- What is the difference between ACCEL1_MeasureGetRawX() and ACCEL1_GetXmg()? 
- Explain in few sentences the process of calibration.
