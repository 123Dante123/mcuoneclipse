\section s_requirement Requirements
Following functionality shall be supported:
- Implement a speed/tacho module
- Think about a good timing with the right number of samples to take.
- Show information/status on the shell

\section s_hints Hints
- Use Tacho.c and Tacho.h as starting point
- NOF_ROUND_PULSE is the number of pulses per revolution. Note that this is the number of signal changes of C1 + C2 (combined!).
- SPEED_CALC_PERIOD_MS needs to be set with the appropriate timing value (milli seconds)
- NOF_HISTORY is used to determine the number of speed samples
- Integrate Trace.c and Trace.h into your application and explore them.
  Use it to show speed information on the shell 
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- How does the tacho sampling period and the number of samples affect the speed calculation?
- We use 'steps per second' as speed entity. Why not using RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)?
