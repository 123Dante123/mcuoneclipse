\section s_requirement Requirements
We want to add a console and shell to configure our target. Additionally this is used as user interface.
There are multiple ways to use a serial console on your host:
- Termite: simple terminal emulation
- HTerm: more options, useful to debug serial applications
- eclipse Terminal view: basic terminal console
To test our first shell implementation, we are going to show the status of the LED on the console.

\section s_hints Hints
- Add FSShell component
- Integrate Shell.c and Shell.h
- S08: increase CPU clock speed to ~20 MHz
- Set Baudrate to 38400
- enable interrupts and allocate input/output buffers
  NOTE: for the 52259 interrupts shall not share priority/level!
- Pin settings:
\verbatim
SCI_RX [Input]           => PTC1_RxD2 [13]
SCI_TX [Output]          => PTC0_TxD2 [12]
\endverbatim
- Tower settings:
\verbatim
TWR_SER_RX_A43 [Input]   => URXD1_I2C_SDA1_PUB1 [63]
TWR_SER_TX_A44 [Output]  => UTXD1_I2C_SCL1_PUB0 [62]
\endverbatim
- For the SRB board, you need to install a host USB to serial driver (on ILIAS).
- For 64bit machines, you find on ILIAS special instructions to install the drivers.
- If you are going to to use the USB CDC class, follow the instructions in the slides.

\section s_questions Questions
- List advantages and disadvantages of using a serial (RS-232) interface for your application.
