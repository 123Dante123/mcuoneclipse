\section s_requirement Requirements
We are going to extend the UI of the TWR-LCD with an additional widget: a slider widget.
That widget allows to set a value in a given range.

\section s_Hints Hints
- Make sure the bootloader on the TWR-LCD works
- You have two projects: one to build the bootloader and one project with the LCD application (with or without bootloader)
- To build a bootloader file, use the _BL_ Processor Expert configuration
- To debug your application without bootloader (which might be easier), use the _noBL_ configuration. Keep in mind that later on you need to put back the bootloader
- The interface is provided with slider.h: implement the module slider.cpp
- It might be easier for now to have everything in slider.cpp. But you are free to implement your classes in separate files.
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- Which method is used to share bootloader files between the Bootloader project and the LCD application project?
- Discuss pros and cons using an object oriented approach for the slider implementation.
