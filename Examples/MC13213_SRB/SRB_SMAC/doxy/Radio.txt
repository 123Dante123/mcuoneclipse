\section s_requirement Requirements
We want to exchange data packets between two systems using a 2.4 GHz radio (ad-hoc network).
Additionally we use a packet sniffer and report every packet with channel number,
data size and data to a terminal (RS-232).

\section s_Hints Hints
- Make sure you use the right pins and settings for the radio transceiver communication
- In case of troubles: keep in mind that you have a new interrupt source and might need more stack
- Do not forget to set PL_HAS_RADIO
- Integrate the new radio module with RADIO_Init()
- Do not forget to integrate the shell routines
- Call RADIO_AppHandleEvent() as part of your event handler
- Call RADIO_Handle() from your main loop to advance the radio state machine
- With everyone sending in the room you will see a lot of communication.
  You need to think about how you can ensure that you only communicate with your own devices
- Use an appropriate channel number and a protocol to avoid conflicts with other communication partners
- Use the provided packet sniffer to see what is going on
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- With the shell you can display the link quality (LQ): how does the reported value change if you move the sender and the receiver further apart?
- Look at the SMAC modem stack/documentation/API. Which functions can you use to
  - Change the communication channel
  - Get the ED value (Receiver Energy Detect)
  - Get the LQI value (Link Quality Indication)
- What kind of possibilities do you have to restrict communication to your own devices?
  Discuss advantages/disadvantages of each approach
