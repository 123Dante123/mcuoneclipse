\section s_requirement Requirements
We are transforming our non-RTOS application into a task based system.
Additionally we enable the sounder (if not already done).
Additionally we are exploring the FreeRTOS scheduling system.
For this we are creating two additional 'test' task.

\section s_hints Hints
- Implement two tasks:
  - Application main loop, handling events
  - Shell task, handling shell and serial console
- Enable Sounder for SRB board (if not already done)
  - Use triggers to start/stop sounder
  - Create a 'welcome' beep (you can do this with the EVNT_INIT event)
  - Create a beep whenever you press a key
- Verify that everything works
- Create two additional test tasks, each toggling an LED, each with tskIDLE_PRIORITY:
\verbatim
static portTASK_FUNCTION(Task1, pvParameters) {
  for(;;) {
    LED1_Neg();
  }
}

static portTASK_FUNCTION(Task2, pvParameters) {
  for(;;) {
    LED2_Neg();
  }
}
\endverbatim
- If you run into a problem: see the Questions section below.
- Have fun :-)  

\section s_journal Questions
- Predict the execution pattern over time of Task1() and Task2().
  Is it matching your expectation or not?
- You likely will run into a problem that the buzzer is not getting stopped.
  Investigate the problem. What is the cause of the problem? How to solve it?
