\section s_requirement Requirements
- The goal is to establish all the interface signals to the motor
  - PWM
  - DIR
  - C1 and C2
- Using two keys, we increase/decrease the PWM cycle
  - 0..100% forward
  - 0..-100% backward

\section s_hints Hints
- An initial motor driver is provided with motor.c and motor.h
- Do not forget to call MOT_Init() from PL_Init()
- It is a good idea to initialize the PWM duty cycle in MOT_Init()
- Test your application
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- What is the maximum speed of the motor (RPM)?
