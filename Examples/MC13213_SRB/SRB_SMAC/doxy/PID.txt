\page page_PID Lab: PID Closed Loop Control
\author Erich Styger, erich.styger@hslu.ch

\section s_requirement Requirements
Following functionality shall be supported:
- Implement a PID closed loop controller for the motor, controlling the speed of the motor
- Use the quadrature encoder as sensor for the speed
- Use the buttons to increase/decrease the desired speed
- Show information/status on the shell

\section s_hints Hints
- Use PID.c and PID.h as starting point
- Think about re-using the tacho/speed sampling periodic interrupt for your PID
- Show current speed values using the trace functionality
- Test your implementation with the magnetic brake. Does your closed loop control react properly?
- Have fun :-)

\section s_journal Questions
- What realtime aspects are exposed with this lab session?
