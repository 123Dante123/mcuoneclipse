\page page_Clock Lab: Clock & Timer
\author Erich Styger, erich.styger@hslu.ch

\section s_requirement Requirements
A realtime system needs precise clocks infrastructure.
In this lab session we are going to set up our system with a 20 MHz bus clock (SRB), and a 40 MHz bus clock for the Tower.
Additionally, we create a timer module. To test it, we are going to blink an LED every second.

\section s_hardware Hardware
- MCF52259 (Tower)
- MC13213 SRB

\section s_hints Hints
- Configure the SRB to 20 MHz (well, close to this) and the MCF52259 to a bus clock of 40 MHz
- Create Timer.c and Timer.h
- Add a Processor Expert component which provides you a 10ms periodic interrupt
- Route the timer interrupt call to your timer module routine
- Every second, create a heartbeat event which is handled in your application event handler
- Have fun :-)  

\section s_questions Questions
- Inspect the MC13213 SRB and the MCF52259: what is its external clock configuration/frequency?
- Think about different ways to verify that your system is running at a bus clock speed you have configured.
- What kind of lab equipment would use to verify the clock speed?
- It would make sense to directly issue the heartbeat in the timer interrupt function, instead creating an event.
  Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
