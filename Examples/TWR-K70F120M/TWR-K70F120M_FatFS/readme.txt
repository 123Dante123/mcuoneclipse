----------
IMPORTANT: This project uses the old/legacy Freescale ARM compiler (not the new ARM GNU GCC one).
Freescale moved to ARM GNU gcc, for all their ARM cores, so this compiler is in maintenance mode.
Please use ARM GNU gcc for new projects.

This project demonstrates the usage of FreeRTOS and FatFS on the TWR-K70F120 board.

Additionally, as shell is implemented which communicates through OSBDM USB CDC port.
