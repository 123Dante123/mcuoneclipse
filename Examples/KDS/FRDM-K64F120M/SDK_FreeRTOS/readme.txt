----------
This is an example project for the FRDM-K64F120M board using the Kinetis SDK with FreeRTOS.
It demonstrates both the 'traditional' FreeRTOS API plus the RTOS abstraction layer in the Freescale Kinetis SDK. 

Note that the project is using linked files to the SDK.
This means you need to have a variable KSDK_PATH pointing to the Kinetis SDK installation root directory.
That variable is defined under Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Linked Resources
